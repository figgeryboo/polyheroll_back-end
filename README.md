# Polyheroll (Back-End)

####  Module 4 Final Project - Bethany A. Torres 2023

***

I created this app to because I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons in my free time. A lot of it. And over the years I've collected dice like no one's business for any character I made in any campaign I was in. I figured, the best app to make was one where I could organize my sets by character.
